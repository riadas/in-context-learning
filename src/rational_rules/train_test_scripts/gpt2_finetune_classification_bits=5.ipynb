    "**Disclaimer:** *The format of this tutorial notebook is very similar to my other tutorial notebooks. This is done intentionally in order to keep readers familiar with my format.*\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is used to fine-tune GPT2 model for text classification using [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library on a custom dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hugging Face is very nice to us to include all the functionality needed for GPT2 to be used in classification tasks. Thank you Hugging Face! \n",
    "\n",
    "I wasn't able to find much information on how to use GPT2 for classification so I decided to make this tutorial using similar structure with other transformers models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Main idea:**\n",
    "Since GPT2 is a decoder transformer, the last token of the input sequence is used to make predictions about the next token that should follow the input. This means that the last token of the input sequence contains all the information needed in the prediction. With this in mind we can use that information to make a prediction in a classification task instead of generation task.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, instead of using first token embedding to make prediction like we do in Bert, we will use the last token embedding to make prediction with GPT2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we only cared about the first token in Bert, we were padding to the right. Now in GPT2 we are using the last token for prediction so we will need to pad on the left. Because of a nice upgrade to HuggingFace Transformers we are able to configure the GPT2 Tokenizer to do just that.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What should I know for this notebook?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Since I am using PyTorch to fine-tune our transformers models any knowledge on PyTorch is very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing a little bit about the [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) library helps too.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## **How to use this notebook?**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Like with every project, I built this notebook with reusability in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "All changes will happen in the data processing part where you need to customize the PyTorch Dataset, Data Collator and DataLoader to fit your own data needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "All parameters that can be changed are under the **Imports** section. Each parameter is nicely commented and structured to be as intuitive as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will cover pretraining transformers on a custom dataset. I will use the well known movies reviews positive - negative labeled [Large Movie Review Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The description provided on the Stanford website:\n",
    "\n",
    "*This is a dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previous benchmark datasets. We provide a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training, and 25,000 for testing. There is additional unlabeled data for use as well. Raw text and already processed bag of words formats are provided. See the README file contained in the release for more details.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this dataset?** I believe is an easy to understand and use dataset for classification. I think sentiment data is always fun to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Coding**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's do some coding! We will go through each coding cell in the notebook and describe what it does, what's the code, and when is relevant - show the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "I made this format to be easy to follow if you decide to run each code cell in your own python notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I learn from a tutorial I always try to replicate the results. I believe it's easy to follow along if you have the code next to the explanations.\n",
